The Society of Nordic Barbershop Singers (SNOBS) organized a Director’s College in Copenhagen the first weekend in February, and participants came from all over Europe, including Sweden, Spain, Ireland, and Germany. Courses were taught by an experienced and inspiring faculty: Rasmus Krigström of the Ringmasters and Zero8 (Sweden), Royce Ferguson of Westminster Chorus (California, USA), and arranger and judge, Rob Campbell (USA).

The newly formed director’s team of Women in Black (Steve, Francis, Eileen, and Nicole) attended this college that offered courses on the best way to learn new music, what a director communicate non-verbally to the chorus, and techniques to bring the most out of singers. It was a great bonding experience for the team. During the breaks, we met and shared what we learned with each other, as well as brainstormed techniques we could incorporate into our rehearsals. There was, of course, much singing all weekend, and we all left on Sunday feeling highly inspired be the best vocal coaches we can be! Now let’s get started: a one, a two, a one, two, three, four…!
